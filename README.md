# CityRouteX-Optimizing-Intra-City-Navigation-using-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
Welcome to CityRouteX, a project dedicated to exploring data-driven intra-city navigation using Dijkstra's Algorithm. 

Description:
CityRouteX is a comprehensive exploration and implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm for optimizing intra-city navigation. This repository contains the codebase, datasets, simulations, and case studies utilized in the research project. The project aims to enhance urban mobility by identifying the shortest and fastest routes within a city, addressing complex urban dynamics, transportation management, and urban design.

This repository contains:
1. Codebase: Python implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm for route optimization within urban environments.
2. Datasets: Hand-curated datasets used for simulations and analysis, including transit networks, station details, and urban mobility data.
3. Case Studies: Detailed case studies demonstrating the application of Dijkstra's Algorithm in optimizing routes within a city.
4. Simulations: Visualizations and simulations showcasing the impact of optimized routes on urban transportation.
5. Research Findings: Summary and insights derived from the project's analyses and experiments.
